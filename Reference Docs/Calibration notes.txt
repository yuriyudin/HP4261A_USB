Open and short calibration ensure that the LCR Meter reads the proper impedance at two extremes: during a virtually zero capacitance (two parallel plates set apart [open calibration]) and during a near zero resistance (two parallel plates in contact [short calibration]).
It is done to remove stray admittance and residual impedance.
This helps ensure you get the best accuracy from the 
instrument. Manufacturers usually state that the instrument will perform 
to its specified accuracy only if a proper open/short calibration has been 
done.


The two most popular frequencies for measurement are double the line frequency (i.e., 100 or 120 
Hz) and 1 kHz. Twice the line frequency is used for filter capacitors and chokes that typically see a 
full-wave-rectified waveform to filter.
For many applications, being able to measure at twice the line frequency and 1 kHz provide enough 
flexibility. More sophisticated LCR meters include more measurement frequencies, such as 10 kHz, 
100 kHz, and higher. H
