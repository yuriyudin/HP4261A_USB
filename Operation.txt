The LCR meter communicates on the USB bus in both remote and local modes. In remote, most of the meter's front panel switches are disabled (exception are the LINE switch and the DC Bias switch). Front panel displays remain active and valid. In remote, the LCR meter settings can be changed and the measurement data read over the USB connection.

LOCAL CAPABILITY
In local, the power meter can be configured to provide the measurement data and measurement parameters on the USB by sending the "SET MEAS CONT" command. By default, the single measurement operation cycle is set and the meter does not send the measurement data out. The measurement mode and parameters are controlled from the front panel. Upon the completion of each measurement, the LCR meter sends the measured data and the measurement settings.

REMOTE CAPABILITY
The LCR meter switches to remote operation upon receipt of the "SET REM ON" message. When the LCR meter switches to remote, the front panel "REMOTE" annunciator turns on. The meter's control settings remain unchanged with the local-to-remote transition and return to the front panel controls upon the return to local. In the remote operation, most of the instrument settings are controlled over the USB.  The exception is the DC Bias voltage which can only be controlled from the front panel. In the remote operation, the meter can be set to measure in the single or continuous cycle. In the single cycle operation (default), the measurement is triggered upon receipt of the "*TRG" command over the USB. The "SET MEAS CONT" command switches to the continuous cycle. Upon the completion of each measurement (whether in the signle or continuous operation), the LCR meter sends the measured data and the measurement settings. The measurement period depends on the signal frequiency setting. At 1000 Hz it is about TBD milliseconds, and at 120 Hz, it is about one second.
